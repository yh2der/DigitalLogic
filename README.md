# Digital Logic Designs

This repository contains implementations of various digital logic circuits and components that I have developed based on concepts learned during my college sessions.

## Included Designs and Notes

1. [3-to-8 Decoder](https://hackmd.io/@-riT80eIQ62MXaWYxK7STQ/BJJBtZ8Gc)
2. [Blocking and Non-Blocking Registers](https://hackmd.io/U0Wn3r1qQDyFmqEYrZl25Q?both)
3. [Voter](https://hackmd.io/@-riT80eIQ62MXaWYxK7STQ/B17TIfQV9)
4. [BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)](https://hackmd.io/@-riT80eIQ62MXaWYxK7STQ/BJJdFGVr5)
5. [PRPG (Pseudo-Random Pattern Generator)](https://hackmd.io/@-riT80eIQ62MXaWYxK7STQ/r1pmJj6Ic)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install Icarus Verilog**
    [Icarus Verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/)

2. **Install Mingw**
    - [Download Mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
    - choose `gcc` `g++` `gcc-g++` `mingw32-make` to install then go to file and change `mingw32-make.exe` to `make.exe`
    - add "/Mingw/bin" to PATH

## Usage
1. run make in the terminal
2. use GTKwave to observe the result(C:\iverilog\gtkwave\bin\gtkwave.exe)
